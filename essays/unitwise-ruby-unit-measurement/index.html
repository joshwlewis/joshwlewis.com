<p>So, way back in Mechanical Engineering school, I learned that a very effective way to check my answers was to make sure the units worked out. For an example, consider a basic physics problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average mass of an adult American male is 86 kilograms. Determine weight of an average man on the moon where the gravitational field is one-sixth that of the Earth (9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you paid attention in physics, you would work it out like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code>  <span class="n">mass</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">86</span> <span class="c1"># 86 kg</span>
  <span class="n">acceleration</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">8</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="c1"># 1.633334 m/s2</span>
  <span class="n">force</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mass</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">acceleration</span> 
  <span class="c1"># =&gt; 140.4666666666667</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, so 140 &ndash; but 140 what? Since we effectively performed &lsquo;kg * m/s<sup>2</sup>&rsquo; it&rsquo;s plain to see that our unit is &#39;kg&sdot;m/s<sup>2</sup>&rsquo;. Ok, great, so our unit result is in the form of a mass times an acceleration, just as we would expect to see when calculating a force. When you are using a pen and paper, this is a great way to make sure your result is what you expect (your force is a measurement force, your energy is a unit of energy).</p>

<p>But using straight up Numerics for calculation through Ruby means that we lose track of units. As the calculation gets more complicated, manual unit checking becomes monotonous and error-prone. On <a href="https://www.emergentcoils.com/">emergentcoils.com</a> I&rsquo;ve had to do a fair amount of these types of calculations (namely heat transfer capacities), and I was getting tired of trying to remember what unit a Numeric value was in.</p>

<p>So, like any good Rubyist, I searched for a RubyGem that could track units as I performed math on them. There are a couple already out there (most notably <a href="https://github.com/olbrich/ruby-units">ruby-units</a>), and they certainly work for many (or probably most) situations. However, they either didn&rsquo;t have a few of the units I needed or they only did conversion (not Math). </p>

<p>During my search, I ended up stumbling across <a href="http://www.unitsofmeasure.org/">The Unified Code for Units of Measurement (UCUM)</a> &ndash; which had all the units I needed ready to go in XML format. From that <a href="https://github.com/joshwlewis/unitwise">Unitwise</a> was born.</p>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s really easy to track units for our example problem:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">mass</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">86</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">kg</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; &lt;Unitwise::Measurement 86 kg&gt;</span>
<span class="n">acceleration</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">convert_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'m/s2'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">6</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; &lt;Unitwise::Measurement 1.6333333333333335 m/s2&gt;</span>
<span class="n">force</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mass</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">acceleration</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; &lt;Unitwise::Measurement 140.4666666666667 kg.m/s2&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And of course it does conversion:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>mass.to_pound
=&gt; &lt;Unitwise::Measurement 189.5975454789947 pound&gt;

force.to_newton
=&gt; &lt;Unitwise::Measurement 140.4666666666667 newton&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, this is a very simple example, but the possibilities are certainly endless. UCUM (and by extension Unitwise) features 95 metric units, 199 non-metric units, and 24 unit prefixes. That&rsquo;s approximately 2,500 basic units to start you with, but these can be combined with multiplication and division for infinite combinations.</p>

<p>You can find Unitwise at <a href="https://github.com/joshwlewis/unitwise">github.com/joshwlewis/unitwise</a>. Check out the README there for installation and additional usage instructions.</p>
